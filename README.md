# Codes and Ciphers
---
A program for display at a museum providing information about the **Caesar Cipher**, the **Vigen√®re Cipher** and the **Straddling Checkerboard Cipher** cipher. 

Please use this if you own a museum and are holding an exhibit on codes and ciphers and require a software package to demonstrate how three traditional ciphers work, as well as provide fascinating historical information on each cipher.

The program is optimised for use on a Windows computer with a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and preferably a printer.
